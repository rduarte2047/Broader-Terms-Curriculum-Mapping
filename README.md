Figure with mappings for a bachelor degree. a) Wordcloud with the 200 most frequent key program concepts. b) Links between the 28 most frequent key program concepts. Wordcloud obtained using the wordcloud package [Fellows, 2018]. Undirected network graph obtained from matrix L_28K using the iGraph package [Csardi and Nepusz, 2006]. Both packages developed for the R programming language [R Core Team, 2019].
